## 🚀 Overview  
The **GenProFit.ai** is an intelligent, automated stock research system designed to help both beginners and experienced investors make smart, data-driven investment decisions.

This project uses a collection of specialized agents—each responsible for analyzing one dimension of a stock—such as financial health, news sentiment, fees, taxes, and predicted growth potential. It estimates the probability that a stock may rise by **5%, 10%, or 20%**, calculates the expected waiting time, and even supports users with **no stock market knowledge** using a beginner auto-invest mode.

The system is built using core Agent concepts:  
✔ Multi-Agent Architecture  
✔ Tools + OpenAPI integrations  
✔ Sessions & Memory  
✔ Long-running operations  
✔ Logging & Tracing  
✔ Agent-to-Agent messaging  
✔ Evaluation & Backtesting
